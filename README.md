# Project Title

Modeling of Nonlinear Selective Compliant Articulated Robot Arm (SCARA) with 4 Links and 4 Degrees of Freedom (4-DOF)

This work focuses on modeling a nonlinear SCARA robot arm with 4 links and 4 degrees of freedom (4-DOF) using two distinct methods: the Newton method and the Euler method. The modeling process involves calculating the following:

Inertia Matrix (M): Represents the mass distribution and dynamics of the robot's links.
Coriolis Matrix (C(ùëûÃá, ùëû)): Accounts for the Coriolis and centrifugal forces.
Gravitational Forces Vector (g): Represents the gravitational effects acting on the system.
Each of these matrices will be calculated independently using the Newton and Euler methods. By comparing and analyzing the results, the complete dynamic model of the SCARA robot is derived.
